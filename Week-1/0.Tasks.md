 -> Learn Variables
 -> Data Types
 -> Loops
 -> Conditionals

 In this series of exercises, I have explored fundamental Python concepts including **variables**, **data types**, **conditional statements**, and **loops**, each demonstrated in separate files for clarity and structured learning. After mastering these individual topics, I applied all of them in a practical scenario by developing a **Restaurant Billing System**.

## Project Overview

The Restaurant Billing System project integrates all the previously learned concepts:

- **Variables and Data Types:** Used to store menu items, prices, quantities, totals, discounts, and final payable amounts.  
- **Conditional Statements:** Applied to determine discounts based on the total bill.  
- **Loops:** Used to repeatedly take orders from the user until they finish, and to iterate over the menu and order summary.

This project not only reinforces the understanding of Python fundamentals but also demonstrates how these concepts can be combined to create a **real-world application** that interacts with the user, processes data, and produces meaningful output.
