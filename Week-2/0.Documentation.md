Python Mini Project – CLI-Based Expense Tracker
Overview

This mini project demonstrates key Python concepts, including:

Creating and using functions and modules

Understanding scope, arguments, and return values

Implementing try–except blocks for error handling

Building a CLI-based (Command Line Interface) application

The project is a simple Expense Tracker CLI App, allowing users to manage their daily expenses through terminal commands.

Features

Add Expense – Add a new expense with name, amount, and category.

View Expenses – Display all expenses with total spending.

Delete Expense – Remove an expense by name.

Save Data – Automatically saves and loads data using a text file.

Error Handling – Handles invalid inputs using try–except blocks.

Key Concepts Used
1. Functions & Modules

Each operation (add, view, delete) is defined as a separate function.

The logic can easily be moved to another file to form a reusable module.

2. Scope, Arguments & Return Values

Demonstrates local scope (variables inside functions) and global data (expense list).

Functions take arguments (e.g., expense details) and return results (e.g., confirmation or total amount).

3. Try–Except Blocks

Used to handle invalid inputs (like entering text instead of numbers).

Prevents program crashes and provides user-friendly error messages.
